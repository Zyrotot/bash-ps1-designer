# Bash PS1 Designer

A small web-based tool to visually design a Bash `PS1` prompt using ANSI colors  
and instantly generate the corresponding shell code, including optional Git
branch parsing.

The live preview approximates bold vs non-bold and bright vs non-bright ANSI
styles inside the browser (badly).
